## About
This project is our final project for Advanced Computer Programming (ACP) class supervised by Dr. Polla Fattah.

For this project we will use Waterfall model as the software development life cycle (SDLC) because the requirements are completed early in the project, enabling the team to define the entire project scope, create a complete schedule, and control the overall application.
